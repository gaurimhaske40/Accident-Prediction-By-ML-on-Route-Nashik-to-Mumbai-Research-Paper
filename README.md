# Accident-Prediction-By-ML-on-Route-Nashik-to-Mumbai-Research-Paper

Researched accident prediction on the Nashik–Mumbai 
route using Machine Learning. Analyzed five years of data 
by road segments, time intervals, and monthly trends to build 
a probability-based model for forecasting accident frequency 
and improving road safety.
